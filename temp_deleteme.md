## What use cases are we trying to support?
- Specify which tests run against local
- Specify which tests run against deployed environment
- Specify which tests run against production
- Be able to share common functions between different tests
- Be able to organize test files based on use cases.
- Be able to organize test based on public and private site
- Run against local, deployed passive, and deployed active environment
- Be able to parallelize test suite between multiple machines for GitHub Actions and CircleCI

## TODO
- Make login accept full email and password

## Ideas
- Could create multiple configuration files for different use cases
- Could have a single generated configuration file
